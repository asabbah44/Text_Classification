info for all relevant accounts, not just the output of the submit rule

When the development is moved from one branch to next in a git project
and we want to get all the open changes from old branch to the new branch,
we have to create a new copy of those changes for the new branch.

Since these changes are not required on the old branch, moving would be
a better fit than other propagation methods (cherrypicking, manual upload).

This change provides a REST API '/changes/{change-id}/move' to
move an open change to a different branch.

199,gerrit,"Pass project to ChangeData so that it can load the change from notes

ChangeData currently loads the change directly from the database, but
now when we support notedb it should load the change via the change
notes factory. Loading the change via the change notes factory
requires the project name in addition to the change ID, hence
ChangeData must know it.

The only caller of ChangeData that cannot provide the project name is
HasDraftByLegacyPredicate. Due to this HasDraftByLegacyPredicate
loads the changes on its own from the database for now. We may remove
this deprecated predicate before migrating to notedb or find another
solution later.

When the change is now loaded from notedb its last modified timestamp
is only precise to seconds, while when its loaded from the database it
is precise to milliseconds. Due to this different changes got the same
last modified timestamp when notedb was enabled and as result the

started to fail. Defining a 1s time clock step for this test fixes
this issue.

200,gerrit,"Implement OpenID based single-sign-on for Google Accounts

This is the early part of our OpenID based SSO implementation.
We now support authentication through the Google Accounts OpenID
provider, allowing users to ""sign in"" and ""sign out"" of the
application through the external provider.

Presently the login servlet is hard-coded to only use Google Accounts
as an OpenID provider.  We should support other providers by setting
up the standard OpenID entry box as the initial content returned
from our login dialog.

The login servlet randomly generates its coookie encryption key
during startup.  This causes any existing user cookies to become
invalid, requiring the user to authenticate again.  At some point
this needs to change to obtain the encryption key from a local
store, where it isn't part of the code base but is preserved across
application server restarts.

In the future we should also support other web based login systems,
such as any in-house web application (such as those used by many
large companies) or just plug in a basic LDAP or database based web
interface, without requiring the complexity of an OpenID provider.

The left and top menu now updates to reflect the current status of

202,gerrit,"Move conversion to SubmitRecords into SubmitRuleEvaluator

Much of this logic is shared between TestSubmitRule and
ChangeControl.canSubmit(), which both depend on this output format.
Move the logic into SubmitRuleEvaluator to lessen the leakage of Term
objects.

The main difference in behavior between these two classes is how
errors are treated. canSubmit() is called by non-admin end users who
get bland error messages telling them to check the server logs;
TestSubmitRule is for admins who need to debug submit rules, and
errors are expected to happen. So we need to distinguish the case when
detailed error messages should go to the user vs. in the logs. Do this
explicitly with a setLogErrors() method on SubmitRuleEvaluator.

",Design,15
203,gerrit,"Rewrite updating comments in NoteDb

The high-level API is simplified: we no longer ask callers to
distinguish between insert/update/upsert, and instead use upsert
everywhere, calling it ""put"". These distinctions were not
particularly important from the perspective of e.g. the REST API.

Although API simplification is a good thing regardless, this change
was primarily driven by the fact that we do not want to use the
eagerly-read ChangeNotes from within ChangeUpdate internals prior to
actually applying the update. The various checkArgument calls in
insert/update/upsert were trying to enforce, for example, that we only
insert changes that don't exist at the time the setter was called.

But in the context of NoteDbUpdateManager that executes multiple
ChangeUpdates in sequence, it doesn't make sense to look up a
comment in the old comment map based on the current branch tip when
the ChangeUpdate instance was created. Instead we should be looking at
the comment map that is the immediate output of the previous update in
the sequence. This distinction is precisely what was causing the test
in I064f004e to fail.

To solve this problem at the storage layer, instead of depending on
the NoteMap from the original ChangeNotes, read the RevisionNotes
from the current revision passed in from the NoteDbUpdateManager
(which may not have been flushed yet, but is still available to the
reader). Don't bother reading the whole ChangeNotes again, as that is
unnecessary. Encapsulate the RevisionNotes and the mutable NoteMap
instance itself in a small POJO, RevisionNoteMap. In the common case
of a single ChangeUpdate, we can even reuse the previously parsed
RevisionNoteMap from the ChangeNotes that was passed in; we only have
to re-read when doing multiple updates.

Mutations are done to the RevisionNoteMap using the same
RevisionNoteMapBuilder idiom we were already using for merging push
certificates with inline comments. Moreover, we can use the same
logic within ChangeDraftUpdate, obviating the need for
DraftCommentNotesParser and simplifying the parse codepath somewhat.

Finally, this change improves reliability and robustness around the
fact that we are writing ref updates to two distinct repositories
non-atomically, the change meta repo and All-Users. Order the updates
so that the write to the change repo happens first, taking advantage
of the fact that comments can only go from DRAFT to PUBLISHED, not
vice versa. If the change update succeeds and the All-Users update
fails, then we will have a zombie DRAFT comment left in All-Users
where there is a PUBLISHED comment in the change repo. We fix this up
in two ways: at read time, by explicitly filtering out any comments
from the draft list that are also published; and at write time, by
deleting all zombie draft comments any time we write any other draft
comment.

Add test cases for a few more combinations of comment updates,
including one that simulates a failed All-Users write.

 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Example</b>:<br>
 * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using
 *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/*
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * then the following request:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>

 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under
 * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not
 * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that
 * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e.,
 * non-content) area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to
 * put CGIs wherever you want, however:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The CGI search path will start at
 *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix
 *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is
 *   null).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting

 *  CGI-invoking servlet for web applications, used to execute scripts which
 *  comply to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification and are named
 *  in the path-info used to invoke this servlet.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: This code compiles and even works for simple CGI cases.
 *          Exhaustive testing has not been done.  Please consider it beta
 *          quality.  Feedback is appreciated to the author (see below).</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Example</b>:<br>
 * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using
 *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/*
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * then the following request:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * would result in the execution of the script
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app-root&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi/dir1/script
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * with the script's <code>PATH_INFO</code> set to <code>/pathinfo1</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under
 * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not
 * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that
 * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e.,
 * non-content) area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to
 * put CGIs wherever you want, however:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The CGI search path will start at
 *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix
 *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is
 *   null).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting
 *   this servlet's cgiPathPrefix init parameter
